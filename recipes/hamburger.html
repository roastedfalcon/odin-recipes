        <ol>
            <li>In large mixing bowl, add in ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Mix by hand until the meat mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>Press meat down in bowl into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the patty mixture into 6 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties.</li>
            <li>Set out baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties. Shape them slightly larger than the buns to account for shrinkage when cooking. Using a spopn, press a dent in the center of each patty so they don't puff up as they cook.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill to medium heat then grill patties for 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Stack hot patties on hamburger buns, and serve with your favorite hamburger toppings.</li>
