        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These are the best homemade french fries from russet potatoes. These are easy to make and they go perfectly with chicken tenders!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 large russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil, can sub canola oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice potatoes into 1/2 inch thick sticks.</li>
            <li>Soak potato slices in cold water for at least one hour, at most overnight. Longer is better as this process removes the starch making our fries crispier.</li>
            <li>Rinse fries twice with cold water.</li>
            <li>Lay fries on paper towels and pat them as dry as possible.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or dutch oven to 300 degrees F. Frying will be done in about six batches. Begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to the oil and fry for about 5-6 minutes. The potatoes should be heating and not crisping yet.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked potatoes on a power towel and fry the remaining bathces.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and fry each batch a second time until they are crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and place on dry paper towels. Sprinkle with salt.</li>
        </ol>
